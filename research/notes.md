## Checked Areas

### Imagery + Basemaps

- FSTopo RecFacility Point
  - not very useful
  - not sure what kind of recreation areas it is showing, but metadata contains almost no info

- FSTopo Transportation Line
  - very small roads of entire US
  - not much metadata about each road, i.e. quality, kind of road, etc. are missing
  - useful to show continuation of roads outside of NFs public land without rendering condition

### Transportation

- National Forest System Roads
  - roads inside NFs public land (outside use FSTopo Transportation Line)
  - include detailed road conditions
  - all along these roads dispersed camping should be allowed

- National Forest System Trails
  - seems incomplete, barely any trails visible in some states
  - however in states like WY, UT, ID, parts of WA shows fairly complete looking trails

- Motor Vehicle Use Map: Roads
  - overlap with the above
  - in some places not available while NF System Roads are
  - give more vehicle specific use info than NF System Roads
  - only seem present in NFs, i.e. haven't seen them in BLMs

- Motor Vehicle Use Map: Trails
  - complements MUVM Roads
  - some overlap
  - show what seems to be small roads/trails inside NFs
  - not complete though, i.e. in some NFs not shown at all

### Boundaries

- Survey Boundaries maintained by the US Forest Service
  - not very useful to see NF boundaries and such
  - spans the entire USA
  - surveyed boundary lines for which the Forest Service is responsible for marking and posting

- National Forest System Land Units
  - US wide shows very high level National Forests
  - does not include any National Parks or State Parks

- Special Status Areas
  - mostly overlap with NFs and add no useful extra info

- National Wilderness Areas
  - mostly inside National Forests
  - smaller subsections, i.e. Cache La Poudre Wilderness

- National Grassland Units
  - overlap in parts with National Wilderness Area and seem to be it's subset

- National Forest Lands with Nationally Designated Management or Use Limitations
  - mostly inside National Forests
  - adjacent but never overlapping National Wilderness Areas

- Ranger District Boundaries
  - encompass Wilderness Areas and NFs
  - don't add more detail to boundaries of these areas

- Administrative Forest Boundaries
  - encompass multiple Ranger District Boundaries
  - don't add more detail to boundaries of these areas

- Forest Service Regional Boundaries
  - encompass very large areas sometimes crossing states

- National Wild and Scenic Rivers
  - shows some Rivers, but not complete by far

- Other Surface Right
  - very small parcels whose ownership is different from surroundings or in dispute

- Public Land Survey System Sections
  - small grid boxes to divide land into survey sections
  - overlap with NFs 90% but don't add any useful info

- Public Land Survey System Townships
  - slightly larger grid boxes (6 miles each side) as the above and largely the same idea

- Right of Way
  - roads that are private but maybe passed
  - useful to determine dispersed camping (i.e. on those roads it won't be allowed)
  - however these roads may need to be passed to get to dispersed camping

- Surface Ownership Parcels, detailed
  - shows in great detail which parts of NFs are really public vs. privately owned
  - very important to determine dispersed camping

- Surface Ownership Parcels
  - same as above but with much less detail and thus not useful

## FTP

- PUMA
  - sections regarding public use
  - didn't see useful info here

- LINEARWATER
  - creeks, rivers, etc.
  - in super high detail, multiple files per state

- ROADS
  - all roads, each file covering very small area
  - super small country roads present, but no info as to their condition

- RAILS
  - rail roads, one file for entire US

- FACES
  - topological data by regions
  - very small regions, lots per state

- POINTLM
  - landmarks, not of great use

- EDGES
  - all lines, mostly roads in great detail
  - hard to see road condition from info
  - very small regions, lots per state
